# Conditional distribution
A conditional distribution is the probability distribution of a random variable, calculated according to the rules of conditional probability after observing the realization of another random variable.


# How do you find the conditional distributions
First, to find the conditional distribution of X given a value of Y, we can think of fixing a row in Table 1 and dividing the values of the joint pmf in that row by the marginal pmf of Y for the corresponding value. For example, to find pX|Y(x|1), we divide each entry in the Y=1 row by pY(1)=1/2.


# What is conditional distribution in contingency table?
The conditional distributions describe the distribution of one variable given the levels of the other variable. The cells of the contingency table divided by the row or column totals provide the conditional distributions.


# What is the difference between conditional and marginal probability?
Marginal probability is the probability of an event irrespective of the outcome of another variable. Conditional probability is the probability of one event occurring in the presence of a second event.

# Formula
Conditional Distributions of Discrete Random Variables. 
                               
                P(A | B)=P(Aâˆ©B)P(B)


p(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring, given that event B occurs
