Image result for what is latent normalizing forms in machine learning
Normalizing Flows are a method for constructing complex distributions by transforming a probability density through a series of invertible mappings. By repeatedly applying the rule for change of variables, the initial density 'flows' through the sequence of invertible mappings.

Four common normalization techniques may be useful:

scaling to a range.

clipping.


log scaling.

z-score.
